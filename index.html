        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Fabricating NMOS Transistor</h3>
            <p>Context: This was an academic project aimed at understanding and executing the process of fabricating NMOS transistors. It involved photolithography, etching, sputtering, and electrical device measurement to ensure adherence to cleanroom standards and device performance criteria.</p>

            <p>Role: I led the evaluation of electrical device parameters post-fabrication and guided multiple stages of production, including photolithography and etching. My role was critical in ensuring accuracy and adherence to standards.</p>
                
            <p>What, How, Why: The goal was to fabricate functional NMOS transistors by accurately following the photolithography and etching processes. I meticulously inspected each step, recalibrated tools when necessary, and introduced stringent inspection protocols to catch errors early. This systematic approach was essential to achieve the desired performance criteria, demonstrating my problem-solving skills and attention to detail.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Multifunction ALU Design</h3>
            <p>Context: This was a class project to design and implement a multifunction ALU capable of performing 11 different arithmetic and logical operations. The objective was to simulate and synthesize the ALU, ensuring its functionality and performance.</p>

                <p>Role: I developed the state machines, synthesized the design, and created comprehensive testbenches for performance verification. My contributions were pivotal in ensuring valid opcode handling and output correctness.</p>
                
                <p>What, How, Why: The ALU design required handling multiple operations with precise control. I simulated the design to produce gate-level outputs and verified them through waveform analysis. The choice of state machines and thorough testing was crucial to ensure robust performance, showcasing my skills in digital design and verification.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Formal Property Verification (FPV) of GCD Design</h3>
            <p>Context: This project involved performing formal property verification on a GCD design using assertions and Questa propcheck. The goal was to validate the design's correctness and achieve 100% functional and code coverage.</p>

                <p>Role: I was responsible for writing properties and assertions to validate the design and debugging them to ensure robust verification. My work ensured that the design met the required specifications.</p>
                
                <p>What, How, Why: The FPV of the GCD design was aimed at ensuring its correctness through formal verification methods. By writing and debugging assertions, I was able to prove the design's robustness. This approach was chosen to provide a high level of confidence in the design's functionality, highlighting my expertise in formal verification techniques.</p>
